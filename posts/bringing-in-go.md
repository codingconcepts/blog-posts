I've made two attemps at bringing Go into a company, once successfully, once unsuccessfully.

Following a successful adoption of the language (through to a Production environment), I wanted to document what I think are the reasons for this adoption, along with the reasons you might fail, as I did with my first attempt.

### Reasons for adopting

##### A good use case

However heartfelt your proposition, if there isn't the use case for Go, you've hit a dead-end.  In my case, a good use case didn't appear until I'd been plugging Go for around 6 months and even then, there was a chance that this use case wouldn't have landed in my team.  Be patience and don't force Go into something it's not suited for, it could backfire and leave you red-faced.

##### Open-mindedness

This is an obvious one but unless your team are open to the idea of deviating from their One True Language, you'll be at a different kind of dead-end.

Look at the tools your company use to develop and deploy their software.  If there is a mix of programming languages being used for different tasks (e.g. C# for APIs, Ruby to deploy via Chef etc.), you might be in luck.  If on the other hand, your company are shoe-horning in the use of C# for C#'s sake, you'll likely have a harder time.

### Reasons for not adopting

##### Enthusiasm

Your colleagues might just not have the enthusiasm to learn a new programming language.  Be this through laziness or complacence, a good way to tackle this is to set them a challenge to be solved using Go.  If they're competitive, this will appeal and if not, there's a chance that it'll appear to their desire to problem-solve.

##### Opinionated peers
##### Narrow-mindedness
##### Closed-mindedness

Closed-mindedness deserves to have a separate bullet here because these are the kind of people I was dealing with when unsuccessful in my attempt to introduce Go.  We've all faced these types of people, it's their way, or the highway.  Added to the fact that because you're suggesting something they're not behind that *they consider you to be wrong*, you've got yourself a challenge.

##### Unhealthily competitive environment

If you're working in a very competitive environment, the people with the deepest knowledge of an existing programming language may be the most vocal contesters to adoption.  There could be a number of reasons for this:

* They're happy that the existing language is all-purpose enough to tackle the problems Go intends to solve / make easier.
* They consider themselves the most fluent with the existing language and don't want to sacrifice this position.
