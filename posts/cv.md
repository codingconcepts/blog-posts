##### Employment History

###### NewVoiceMedia (July 2016 - present) 

<div style="text-align: justify">
I work in the IVR (Interactive Voice Response) team at NewVoiceMedia.  We're a small Kanban team, who pair-programme, dev/test pair and are held up to be the model Agile team in the DevOps department.<br/><br/>

The software created by the IVR team handles many thousands of calls at any one time, allowing our customers to administer highly dynamic call flows.  We're responsible for everything between and including the interfaces our customers use to administer their call plans to the runtime logic which routes calls through the system and various other interconnected systems.<br/><br/>

In addition to my work in the IVR team, I am propagating the use of the Go programming language across the department.  I'm doing this by way of lunch-and-learn sessions, one-on-one tutoring and providing projects kick-offs and code reviews.<br/><br/>

My proudest achievement at NewVoiceMedia to-date, is the adoption of Go for a mission-critical text-to-speech service.  The company decided to use Go, following my recommendations and I’ve enjoyed teaching the language to my team members and completing the system well within our estimate.<br/><br/>

###### Smartodds (August 2014 - July 2016)

<div style="text-align: justify">
At Smartodds, I worked in an agile team responsible for bet placement and market data/stats retrieval for quant models.  This role allowed me to function as a front-office and server-side developer interchangeably and I became a go-to for the middle tier because of my work with RabbitMQ; building the company’s central message bus, which is used across the business and extensively by clients outside the business.<br/><br/>

I was known for my love of developing proof-of-concepts and my ability to build them quickly.  My versatility, sense of teamwork, readiness to help and mentor colleagues was also frequently noted.  In addition to my day-to-day duties, I could be relied upon to scout out technologies which would benefit the company.  In my time at Smartodds, I scouted out and oversaw the adoption of ZeroMQ, RabbitMQ, Dapper and LINQPad.<br/><br/>

One of my favourite non-technical responsibilities at Smartodds was the developer interview process.  I liaised with recruiters, vetted candidates, produced interview content and conducted phone and face-to-face interviews.<br/><br/>

###### Glencore (November 2011 - August 2014)

<div style="text-align: justify">
At Glencore, I functioned as Subject Matter Expert for UX and UI development and a number of widely used internal core components, which I developed and maintained and whose use I promoted within the company.  I was also a go-to for all things C#, WPF, WCF, LINQ, UX, UI, multithreading, security and build-pipeline related, helping developers of all levels write code and design interfaces.<br/><br/>
</div>

###### Barclays Capital (April 2010 - November 2011)

<div style="text-align: justify">
During my time at BarCap, I helped design, develop and build automated tests for the WPF-based base and precious metals trading platform.  I fostered great relationships with the traders, sales and operations staff through work groups, presentations and third-line support.<br/><br/>

My proudest achievement at BarCap was the design and development of a real-time WPF position-monitoring interface, used heavily by traders, sales and operations.<br/><br/>
</div>

###### Navitas Solutions (June 2009 - April 2010)

<div style="text-align: justify">
In my role at Navitas, I developed bespoke solutions that interfaced with all major Global Distribution Systems (GDS) for clients in the travel industry using C#, WPF, WCF, MySQL and the Boo programming language.<br/><br/>

My proudest achievement at Navitas was the design and development of a robust application framework, which acts as a transparent interface between Navitas and all GDSs.  It’s used as the foundation for all of their products and is used by many thousands of travel agents today.<br/><br/>
</div>

###### Reveal Media (April 2006 - June 2009)

<div style="text-align: justify">
My development career began at Reveal Medial during my university “industrial placement” year.  During my tenure, I led the design and development of a solution which is used by the majority of police constabularies around the UK.  My development efforts represent a major part of an application, which handles evidential video footage from portable surveillance equipment.  As part of these developments, I would frequently provide rapid proof-of-concepts, run exhibition booths and demonstrate my software to constabularies around the country.<br/><br/>

I was asked to continue working for Reveal Media during my final year and I continued to develop for them full-time upon the completion of my degree.<br/><br/>
