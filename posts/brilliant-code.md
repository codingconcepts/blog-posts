##### tl;dr

If you read code that clearly aims to impress, exert prowess, you're probably dealing with "Brilliant Code".  We've all been guilty of writing Brilliant Code at some point in our careers and some more than others.

##### Overview

Brilliant code refers to code that satisfies any number of the following:

* Almost *always* a solo effort.
* Reviewed almost *always* by someone who isn't empowered enough to ask for clarification or say what they think about it.
* Developed to impress other developers.
* Developed to show prowess *over* other developers.
* Comprises a marriage of failed attempts at design patterns (or anything that would make Uncle Bob question your undestanding of levels of abstraction).
* If tested, is tested with even more obscure, impenetrable unit tests.  Owing either to how difficult the code has become to test, or because it's an extension of their impress/prowess code.

##### The problems

The problem with brilliant code is two-fold:

1. The person who's writing it.

They're likely not a team-player, a lone-ranger, overly confident, a bit abrasive and unlikely to take critisism or alternative ideas with open ears.

A geninely brilliant and much loved colleague of mine has coined a pattern that I think is fitting for a such a developer:  The Closed-Open Principle.

2. The people who are allowing them to write it.

If you know there's a dangerous developer in your flock, it's your responsibility and the responsibility of your management to so something about it.


The members of my team have a literal bottle of hand-santiser we'll frequently use when wading through brilliant code.  We use it ceremonially to highlight how dirty we're feeling.

Unfortunately, this isn't even the mainstay of dangerous developers, the same can be said for truly brilliant developers working within teams of less experienced developers.  If they're leaving a trail of brilliance behind them that no one's able to keep up with or understand, then how valuable *is* their code?

##### Effects

There are a couple of things you can do once you've encountered brilliant code, one of them is probably the correct thing to do, the others are probably what you'll end up doing:

1. Run away.  Implement something similar and simpler on the side, doing rock the boat and don't break what isn't broken.

This is the easiest way to tackle the problem.  Only you're not tackling the problem at all.  The problem with brilliant code is the person who wrote it.

If you care about yourself, your future self, your company and those around you, please, for the love of all things holy, write **sensible** code.
