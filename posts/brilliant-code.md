I'm not a very nice person.  This post isn't referring to beautiful nuggets of excellence I've discovered whilst traipsing through my company's ginormous codebase.

##### Brilliant code
`Brilliant code` refers to code that satisfies any number of the following:

* Developed to satiate the curiosity of the writer.  *Always* to the detriment and sanity of the readers
* Makes the reader say any of the following, in any order [ "WFT", "this is great, great work", "what pattern even is this?" ]
* Is almost *always* a solo effort
* If tested, is tested with even more obscure, impenetrable unit tests

The members of my team have a literal bottle of hand-santiser we'll use when wading through brilliant code.  Just to highlight how dirty we're feeling.

##### Truly brilliant code
Code that's actually brilliant 


##### Summary
If you care about yourself and those around you, please, for the love of God, write sensible code.
